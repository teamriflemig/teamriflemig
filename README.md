## Hi there 👋
I'm Axio — I like building things, experimenting, and learning in my own flow.

Not a programmer — just someone with strong fundamentals who loves vibecoding.

I build when the inspiration hits and learn by feeling the system,
not just following steps.

Less grind, more flow.
Less theory-only, more hands-on.

Hobbies:
• Vibecoding 🎧
• Gaming 🎮
• Exploring tech & systems
• Building things for fun
